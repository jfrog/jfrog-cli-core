# This test verifies that gradle-dep-tree.jar and maven-dep-tree.jar are kept up-to-date with the version specified in buildscripts/download-jars.js. 
# It accomplishes this by downloading the JARs and executing a "git diff" command. 
# In case there are any differences detected, the test will result in failure.
